# Ionic + Angular basic app

## Get started
```
$ ipm install
$ ionic serve
```
This will launch the app in the browser.
For testing it on a mobile device use:
```
$ ionic serve --devapp
```
For more details on the Ionic DevApp this see this short [Ionic Document](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/your-first-app/ios-android-camera#install-devapp).

## To Do
- build a nicer UI (e.g. implement the proposed design, enhance UI with elements like ion-infinite-scroll, ion-loading, ion-refresher)
- take advantage of local storage for when the user refreshes the app
- cache API responses locally
- add form validation
- write tests
- refactor code: add interfaces, constants (e.g. for paths like /albums)
- reduce duplicated code (e.g. build a shared header component)
- map API objects to model
- have a glass of champagne ðŸ¥‚
